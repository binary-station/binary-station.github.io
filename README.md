## Welcome

<br>
BinaryStation is a one man game development shop.

Im a programmer by trade,
with a very old hobby for game development.

My first introduction to programming was on a z80 clone,
learning BASIC and creating some small games.

I created this site to show my work, and hope people will find my creations interesting.
