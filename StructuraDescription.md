**Gameplay**

Fight for survival.

The sentinel provides offensive/defensive capabilities.

The main base(known as the unit) can be expanded by using components

on 6 directions(left,right, up, down, front, back).

Each component is linked to the ship by one socket and one tunnel.

19 different components are available from economy to military purposes.

Other units can be attached so the base can be expanded indefinetly

 on any direction(providing enough resources).

Gather resources, fight, survive
