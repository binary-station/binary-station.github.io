## Structura manual<br><br>

## Introduction

    Structura is a rather unique sci-fi real time strategy set in space.

    Its a hybrid of rts and fps, emphasis on combat and survival
    , the economy is important for the war effort.

    You are the commander of a combat unit of the Human Resistance Fleet.

    Build your economy for war, modify the unit by adding components,
    explore, expand and survive the savage waves of enemies attacks.
    Scan and destroy enemies, plan your defenses, jump the unit to safety.

## How to play

    Play the first tutorial! 

    Videos for the in game tutorials:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Standard tutorial play through](https://youtu.be/QyBNwY2LrFs)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Advanced tutorial play through](https://youtu.be/bSoLLzaFHoI)<br>

    Dont try to play the game without finishing boths tutorials.
    It will just be confusing.

    The game may look complex but once understood its fun to play and gameplay is unique. 
    This is the best i could do to explain it.

## Howtos, help

    Help is available anytime in game (in main menu).

    Howtos available in the menu:
    Main > System > Howtos

    The howtos describe how to do operations in the game.
    I advise to look there if you forget things.

    For general information:
