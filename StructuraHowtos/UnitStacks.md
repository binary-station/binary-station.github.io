**Howto unit stacks**<br><br>


Unit provide stacks for storing data

The stacks are a communication method, also used as input to commands

To access the stacks use the console

By default the stacks inputs are disabled

To activate:

Main > Input > Stacks > Input on
<br><br>

Write a number in console and enter , it will be stored on the current stack

Arithmetic operations and stack manipulation can be performed

Stacks are named and can be created as needed, there are no limits

Some unit commands use stacks as input
<br><br>

Information on the current stacks can be seen:

Main > Input > Stacks > Information
