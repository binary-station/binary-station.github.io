The accelerator is inactive by default, is not producing antimatter.
Resources are needed on the socket attached to the accelerator.
To add resources to socket:

Start the accelerator: Main > Components > Accelerator > Online
It will consume the resources from that socket.
Once resources are finished it automatically shuts down.

Resource saving is important , start the accelerator only when neeeded.
