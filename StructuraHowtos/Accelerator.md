**Howto get antimatter, accelerator usage**<br><br>

Attach a socket,tunnel,accelerator in this order.

Main > Unit > Mods > Attach

The accelerator is inactive by default, is not producing antimatter.

Resources are needed on the socket attached to the accelerator.

To add resources to socket:

Main > Components > Socket > Storage fill
<br><br>

Start the accelerator: 

Main > Components > Accelerator > Online

It will consume the resources from that socket.

Once resources are finished it automatically shuts down.

Resource saving is important , start the accelerator only when neeeded.
