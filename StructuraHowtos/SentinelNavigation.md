**Howto fly the sentinel**<br><br>

Each unit has one sentinel, at beginning is docked to the unit.

The sentinel is the main unit defender,

its only linked to the priest commander cybernetic simulation.
<br><br>

To undock (Main > Sentinel > Undock)",

W,A,S,D,Q,E + mouse for direction",

To dock back (Main > Sentinel > Dock)",
<br><br>

Important things to know:",
- Has a limited range, if you pass the range sentinel will be stuck in space.",
- Onboard energy reserves are used for flying , deplete that and you are a sitting duck.",

If you manage to be get stuck in space  only way to return to unit is by self destruct.",

(Main > Sentinel > Selfdestruct)",
<br><br>
Then reconstruct a new sentinel:",
(Main > Sentinel > Reconstruct).",
<br><br>

This is pretty expensive so is better to not loose sentinels unless really necessary.",

Range of the sentinel before upgrades is 40au."
